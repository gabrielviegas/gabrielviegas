Hey there 👋

I'm Gabriel Viegas. I’m a DevOps enthusiast dedicated to building resilient infrastructure and making automation a priority.

What first drew me to DevOps was the ability to eliminate repetitive manual tasks. I truly enjoy the efficiency gains that come from replacing manual toil with smart, automated workflows.

When I'm not orchestrating containers or tuning pipelines, I stay active at the gym and through physical exercise. I am also a violinist—it's my favorite way to disconnect and practice discipline. In my downtime, I enjoy watching thriller movies or experimenting with new setups in my homelab.
